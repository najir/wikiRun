# Description

A very simple Electron Application that will allow user to open their wiki.js website with a click of a button. 
The reasoning behind this is to create a faster way to access my notes wiki, without the overhead of a web browser and
without the need to manually type in the ip-address. Again this is a very simple application unless I can find some
way to justify more functionality.

App will ask for the local IP to your wiki and load it in the electron app on start up using electron-store.

This is to supplement my local wiki. To run your own, check out my blog: https://irrperks.dev/blog/5
